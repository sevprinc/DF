# Overview
This project applies the method of double operations for deepfake detection.

# Dataset
The dataset can be found at https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1QhAOZRXO0_PN-DkKbUCkzjM6WfXLaE_m
The raw and deepfake videos of ten public figures are saved in the folder 'celeb_videos'.
The reconstructed videos of the raw and deepfake videos can abe found in the folder 'reconstructed_videos'.
Before running the experiments, the videos should be downloaded.

# Usage
To save computational time, the [prepare features file](https://github.com/sevprinc/DF/blob/main/notebook/prepare%20features.ipynb) is first used to extract features from the frames using a pretrained neural network.
